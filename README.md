# nextcloud_user_provisioning
PHP for easy automation using the user provisioning api of nextcloud (and probably owncloud)

I coded this class to simplify the usage of the nextcloud user provisioning api for people like me, who are stuck in shared hosting environments where no real console line commands can be used.
If this class can be useful for you - you may use it without any warranty.
